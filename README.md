lcheapo_obspy
===================

The missing link between LCHEAPO data and ObsPy

Overview
------------

### Command-line programs:

| Program | description |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| lcplot | plot an LCHEAPO file |
| lctest | plot LCHEAPO tests |
| lc2SDS_weak | converts LCHEAPO file to SeisComp Data Structure, with basic drift correction |
| lc_examples | create a directory with examples of lcplot and lctest |

### lctest control files

lctest uses YAML-format control files to indicate what kind of plots to output.  There are 4 main sections in each file:

**``input``**: input data parameters
  - **``starttime``**: starttime to read (0 means from the beginning of each file)
  - **``endtime``**: end time to read (0 means to the end of each file)
  - **``datafiles``**: a list of the LCHEAPO files to read
    - **``name``**: the filename
    - **``obs_type``**: the obs type (used for spectral instrument responses, possible values are given
                    in the help for ``lcplot``
    - **``station``**: station name to use for this file in the plots

**``output``**: output plot file parameters
  - **``show``**: show the plots?  If False, just save them to files
  - **``filebase``**: each output file will start with this

**``plots``**: the plots to make
  - **``time_series``**: a list of standard waveform plots
      - **``description``**: text to put in plot title
      - **``select``**: parameters to use to select a subset of all the waveforms (see obspy.core.stream.Stream.select())
      - **``start_time``** and **``end_time``**: allow you to plot a subwindow of the read data
  - **``particle_motion``**: list of particle motion plot types
  - **``spectra``**: list of spectra plots
      - **``description``**: as in ``time_series``
      - **``select``**: as in ``time_series``
      - **``start_time``** and **``end_time``**: as in ``time_series``
  - **``stack``**: plot waveforms from different times on the same channel together.  This useful for single stations where you did the same think (tap, lift, etc) several times, to be sure that the input and response were consistent.
       - **``description``**: as in ``time_series``
       - **``orientation_codes``**: list of orientation codes to plot (one plot will be made for each orientation code (the last letter of the channel name))
       - **``times``**: list of times to plot at (each one "yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS")
       - **``offset_before.s``**: start_time will be this many seconds before each ``time``
       - **``offset_after.s``**: end_time will be this many seconds after each ``time``
  - **``particle_motion``**: list of particle motion plots to make.  Used to confirm
    the polarity/orientation of the channels.  EAch plot will contain time series subplots
    for each channel and a particle motion plot combining the two.  Generally, the time span of
    the time-series plot should envelope that of the particle motion plot.  A bit silly that it uses
    ``times``, like ``stacks`` does, since it doesn't plot all of the times together.  I think I did
    it because we generally look at particle motions for the same taps that we do stacks on.
       - **``description``**: as in ``time_series``
       - **``orientation_code_x``**: orientation code to plot on the x axis
       - **``orientation_code_y``**: orientation code to plot on the y axis
       - **``times``**: list of times to plot at (each one "yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS")
       - **``offset_before.s``**: start_time for particle motion plot will be this many seconds before each ``time``
       - **``offset_after.s``**: end_time will for particle motion plotbe this many seconds after each ``time``
       - **``offset_before_ts.s``**: as above, but for the time series plot
       - **``offset_after_ts.s``**: ditto

**``plot_globals``**: Default values for each type of plot.  Use the same names and values as for **``plots``**
